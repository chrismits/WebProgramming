<title>COMP 20: Web Programming - Lab: Document Object Model and Events</title>
</head>

<body>
<h1>COMP 20: Web Programming</h1>
<h2>Lab: <span class="stress">Closed Captioning</span></h2>

<h2>Lab Objectives</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Practice writing JavaScript.</li>
	<li>Practice using the Document Object Model (DOM).</li>
	<li>Practice with using JavaScript objects.</li>
	<li>Understand event handling and using first-class function.</li>
	<li>Recognize the power of HTML5.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>HTML5 introduces built-in media support via the <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> elements, offering the ability to easily embed and manipulate media on web pages (Mozilla.org).  In this lab, you will create a web page that annotates a music video with text and perhaps other media.</p>

<h2>The Video</h2>
<p>The video that you will annotate is an old song:</p>

<video src="https://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/20/classic.mp4" id="a_classic" controls>
</video>
<p>You are free to use the following to access the video on your page and there is no need to make a copy of the video onto your computer:</p>
<pre>
&lt;video src="https://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/20/classic.mp4" id="a_classic" controls&gt;

<h2>Lyrics to "Hush Hush Hush Here Comes The Bogey Man"</h2>
<pre>
Children have You ever met the Bogeyman before
No, of course You haven't for You're much too good, I'm sure;
Don't You be afraid of him if he should visit You,
He's a great big coward, so I'll tell You what to do

Hush, hush, hush, here comes the Bogeyman,
Don't let him come too close to You, he'll catch you if he can.
Just pretend that you're a crocodile
And you will find that Bogeyman will run away a mile.

Say Shoo shoo and stick him with a pin
Bogeyman will very nearly jump out of his skin
Say buzz buzz just like the wasps that sting
Bogeyman will think you are an elephant with wings

Hush, hush, hush, here comes the Bogeyman
Tell him you've got soldiers in your bed
For he will never guess that they are only made of lead

Say Hush hush, he'll think that you're asleep
If you make a lovely snore away he'll softly creep
Sing this tune you children one and all
Bogeyman will run away, he'll think it's Henry Hall!

When the shadows of the evening creep across the sky
And your Mummy comes upstairs to sing a lullaby
Tell her that the bogeyman no longer frightens you
Uncle Henry's very kindly told you what to do

Hush, hush, hush, here comes the Bogeyman
Don't let him come too close to you, He'll catch you if he can.
Just pretend your teddy bear's a dog
Then shout out, 'Fetch him, Teddy!' and he'll hop off like a frog.

Say Meoow, pretend that you're a cat
He'll think you may scratch him that make him fall down flat
Just pretend he isn't really there
You will find that Bogey man will vanish in thin air

Here's one way to catch him without fail
Just keep a little salt with you
and put it on his tail

&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" type="text/css" /&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;

&lt;body&gt;

&lt;h1 id="title"&gt;A Classic&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;video src="https://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/20/classic.mp4" id="a_classic" controls&gt;&lt;/video&gt;
&lt;div id="lyrics"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
	// Complete this section and create a CSS file named style.css
